Hi I am Chamindu Munasinghe a Software Architect/Developer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. I have 15+
years of experience designing and developing software systems using various technology stacks. I am passionate about software architecture and code quality.

If I had to thank one person for who I am today that would be my father Ranjan Munasinghe. He is 
an Electronics Engineer and I grew up going to his visiting lecture sessions and helping his various consulting projects where I found my interest for all things tech and learned how to think like an engineer.

when not writing code I like to spend time with my family (I thought managing client expectations and dev teams was the most difficult thing until I had my son :-P) and my various hobbies (DIY, [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1443073-chamindu), Electronics and [Photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chamindu/). I also own some music instruments that I wish I could play better.

When it comes to political/religious views; according to political compass I inhabit [left libertarian](https://www.politicalcompass.org/certificate?pname=Chamindu+Munasinghe&ec=-6.75&soc=-6.0) quadrant in between Noam Chomsky and Bernie Sanders.
